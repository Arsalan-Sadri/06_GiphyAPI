* Once you hit your choice, the application pulls 10 gifs from GIPHY API and have them displayed on the page
* For example, a 'paris' search term would look like this:

<img src="Docs/Images/paris_search.png" >


* You can then click on each gif to make it animate and click again to stop the animation
* You also have options to choose your own topic of interest and/or modify the number of gifs to be pulled from GIPHY API
* Once you enter your search term and click submit, the search term will be added to the list at the top of the page
* You can then click this newly-added search term to make the page populate gifs
